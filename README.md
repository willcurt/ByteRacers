# ByteRacers
A 2D maze-racing game made using SDL3, C++, CMake

**On Mac:**
- Install SDL3 on system

Suggestions:
- Install homebrew
- Install gcc and pkgconf

- Download CMakeLists.txt, main.cpp, assets, build.sh into ByteRacers directory using: % `git clone https://github.com/willcurt/ByteRacers.git`

In terminal:
- Run: % `chmod +x build.sh`
- Run: % `./build.sh`

Just running: % `./build.sh` from now on will build and run the project (should compile, create executable, and run executable per native resources)
